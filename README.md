# autokuso

### This splitter is for the game kuso by Fred Wood. It will basically do everything you want it to do which is:

* Sync IGT with the game's framecounter
* Starts upon starting any game mode (tested with speedrun kuso, LOVE and LOVE+kuso but should theoretically work on any mode)
* Restart upon resetting the game
* Reset upon exiting to main menu
* Splitting during a level progression
* Ending when the run is beaten and stats are shown (tested in speedrun mode only but should theoretically work on all game modes)

Install by setting "kuso" as the game in your splits, then click on "Activate" for the autosplitter.

Be sure to set your Livesplit to compare to Game Time as opposed to Real Time!
Have fun! 
If there are any issues, let me know or rather let Gelly know, he did all the hard work, I just researched the values for him and sent them via Discord.
